All three game engines allow users to create a level using assets in a simple way. They could all drag the assets into the scene and move them around the world using their transform components. They also have a simple method to import the assets, either by dragging the files directly into the engine or right-clicking and importing them individually. However, they all have a different way of creating a level when it comes to details. In Godot, the levels and objects all function as a "scene," which makes no difference between them. In Unity, the objects are simply objects, and dragging them into the scene would make them part of the level. In Unreal, the assets that are dragged into the scene are static meshes, which aren't commonly used as the most efficient way is to create an actor blueprint. Prefabs are the simplest to understand, as it simply saves a group of assets as one whole object, while a packed scene is similar, which holds all the nodes in the scene as one scene. On the other hand, blueprint actors would save the assets as different types of files, which can be coded in a built-in blueprint. In my opinion, I would choose to build the level in Unity as I feel like it is the most convenient engine to build a level since the controls are simple with how prefabs are made, and objects are placed directly in the scene.
